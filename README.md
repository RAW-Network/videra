## 🚀 Installation and Usage Guide

Follow these steps to download and run the project on your machine

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Docker & Docker Compose
* Node.js *(Optional for development)*
* FFmpeg *(Only required for local runs without Docker)*

### ▶️ Run with Docker (Recommended)

```yaml
services:
  videra:
    image: ghcr.io/raw-network/videra:latest
    container_name: videra
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    devices:
      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
    volumes:
      - ./compressed:/compressed
      - ./uploads:/uploads
      - ./logs:/logs
    environment:
      - MAX_VIDEO_UPLOAD_SIZE=500M
      - FORCE_CPU_ENCODER=true
      - TZ=UTC
    restart: unless-stopped
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

3. Access the application at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

4. To stop the application:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## 💡 Hardware Acceleration (VA-API)

To enable GPU acceleration, you must pass your host machine's DRI devices to the container

> ⚠️ Ensure the Docker user has permission to access `/dev/dri` (typically by being in the `render` or `video` group)

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Customize the application using environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`

| Variable                | Description                              | Default |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `MAX_VIDEO_UPLOAD_SIZE` | Maximum allowed size for uploads         | 1G      |
| `FORCE_CPU_ENCODER`     | Set to `true` to force software encoding | false   |
| `TZ`                    | Sets the container's timezone            | UTC     |
